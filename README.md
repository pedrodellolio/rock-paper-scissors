Play around with the simulation here: [https://rock-paper-scissors-simulation.vercel.app/](https://rock-paper-scissors-simulation.vercel.app/).

This project is a simple simulation of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors". It allows you to specify the number of rock, paper, and scissors entities to simulate their interactions on a canvas. The entities move around and compete against each other based on the rules of the game.

This project uses Javascript to handle the logic of the simulation and HTML/CSS to create the interface. The icons used are sourced from: https://fonts.google.com/icons
